OOP Animals

As part of the recruiting process, we'd like you to complete this simple coding assignment.  Although you are not being timed, our expectation is that you won't need to spend more than a few hours on this exercise.  Please complete it and return to your hiring manager at your earliest convenience.

In a language of your choice (PHP preferred), please create a command line application that will accept a name and an animal type.  On receiving the input, the application should respond with an appropriate message from that animal.  For example,

    # php AnimalProject.php "Mr Pickles" cat

    Mr Pickles says "meow"

The application must use object inheritance for its implementation
The application should support at least the following animals
cat (output: <name> says "meow")
dog (output: <name> says "woof")
cow (output: <name> says "moo")
unicorn (output: Unicorns are not real)
The application should not fail when an unknown animal name is received
Unit tests should be included

Please also provide instructions on how to build, install and run as appropriate.

Optionally, feel free to add enhancements.  Some ideas:

Ability to support new animal types without changing existing code (plug & play animals)
Ability to persist and reload animals offline (database, file, etc.)
Ability to create multiple animals at once
Support for additional attributes for animals (age, height, favorite food, etc.)
Anything else that showcases your talents
